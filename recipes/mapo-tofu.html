    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I think the most difficult part of this dish is nailing down that tangy mouth-piercing spice. But so long as you have enough chilli variations, you should not need those specialized spices you read on other websites! This is a recipe I somewhat improved upon from the net after tasting it myself a few times, so I hope you like it!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4><i>(Serving Size: 2)</i></h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>90ml </b>olive oil</li>
      <li><b>2 </b>fresh chilli peppers<i>(roughly chopped)</i></li>
      <li><b>8 </b> dried red chillis<i>(roughly chopped)</i></li>
      <li><b>2<sup>1/2</sup>tbsp </b>ginger<i>(finely minced)</i></li>
      <li><b>2<sup>1/2</sup>tbsp </b>garlic<i>(finely minced)</i></li>
      <li><b>200ml </b>chicken stock</li>
      <li><b>450g </b> silken tofu<i>(cut into size of choice)</i></li>
      <li><b>250g </b> minced pork</li>
      <li><b>3 tbsp </b>spicy bean sauce</li>
      <li><b>1<sup>1/2</sup>tbsp </b>cornstarch</li>
      <li><b>50ml </b>water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><h4>Chilli Oil Prep</h4>
      <p>Pour in <small>3/4 </small> of the olive oil and ensure pan is lightly coated. I say lightly because you want to use as little as possible, but still have enough to comprise what you want to use as chilli oil. Heat up the wok lightly so as the oil not to spurt, and add the chopped chilli variations. Stir occasionally for 5 minutes, letting the fragrance come out but not letting the chilli become burnt, then remove everything and set aside.</p></li>
      <li><h4>Minced Meat Prep</h4>
      <p>Heat the remaining <small>1/4 </small>oil and mix in the ginger. Stir for 1 minute on medium heat, then add the garlic for another minute. Mix in the minced pork and fry until completely cooked through.</p></li>
      <li><h4>Making the Base</h4>
      <p>Add the spicy bean sauce and mix until coated throughout. If you like it extra spicy, consider adding more of the bean sauce! Then add the chicken broth and stir, letting it then simmer for a minute. The chicken stock amount varies up to you. Add more if you want the dish to be more liquified, less if you want a thicker dish.</p></li>
      <li><h4>Thickener</h4>
      <p>Prepare a cornstarch mixture using the cornstarch and water, then adding that mixture to the sauce. After mixing it, let it boil until the sauce thickened.</p></li>
      <li><h4>Final Ingredients</h4><p>Only after you are happy with the thickness do you add your chilli oil and tofu. Gently, gently mix the tofu around so as to not break up the pieces, and let it further cook for 5 minutes.</p></li>
    </ol>
