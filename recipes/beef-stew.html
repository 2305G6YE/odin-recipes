  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>I stumbled upon this dish when I was looking for something hearty I could put together in winter. When it is that time of the year generally people would want something nourishing and warm. I altered the base recipe myself a little bit more of a kick using alternate meat sources around my area, and so can you! Just bear in mind some meats do not do as well as others when it comes to long simmering, so I recommend beef.</p>
