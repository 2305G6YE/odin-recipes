        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I stumbled upon this dish when I was looking for something hearty I could put together in winter. When it is that time of the year generally people would want something nourishing and warm. I altered the base recipe myself a little bit more to give a kick using alternate meat sources around my area, and so can you! Just bear in mind some meats do not do as well as others when it comes to long simmering, so I recommend beef.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><h4>Precooking Beef</h4><p>Heat a non-stick pan of your size to medium heat and add the oil. After it has coated the pan, add the beef chunks and sear quickly. Remove after all sides has been cooked and let it rest on the side.</p></li>
          <li><h4>Vegetables and Stew</h4><p>Using the oil from the beef, transfer it to a large pot (where the stew will be housed) and cook the onion, carrots and celery until softened, seasoning with salt and pepper (about 7 minutes). Add your garlic and tomato paste and stir until fragrant and darkened (roughly 2 minutes). Put in the precooked beef and add the remainder of your spices and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and stir occasionally for 30-45 minutes until beef is tender. </p></li>
          <li><h4>Potatoes</h4><p>For the final step, add the potatoes into the simmered stew and leave til tender (15 minutes approx), then the peas for 2 minutes. Add salt and pepper as desired.</p></li>
