    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>So when we were studying in Japan, the topic often came up about how to make quick foods that offered optimum nutrition given our busy lifestyles. This one is provided to me by a friend of mine called Nikita. It is his own rendition of a oatmeal but designed for bodybuilders!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p><i>(Serving Size: 1)</i></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Oatmeal<i>(of choice)</i></li>
      <li><b>200ml </b>milk</li>
      <li><b>2 servings </b>protein scoop<i>(around 20g each)</i></li>
      <li>Granola<i>(with nuts)</i></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><h4>Oatmeal Prep</h4><p>Pour in as much oatmeal as desired, pour in the milk and immediately put it into the microwave until the milk is warm.</p></li>
      <li><h4>Protein</h4><p>After removing it from the microwave, mix in the protein gradually, not dumping it all in one go. Stir as to not make the oats soggy, but mixed to the point the powder has dissolved.</p></li>
      <li><h4>Granola</h4><p>As a final step, pour the granola of your choice (we recommend one with cashew nuts) on the top. This addition at the end ensures the crunchy feeling when you eat this meal, as the granola is still pretty much dry during consumption. Almost functions like a sprinkle</p></li>
    </ol>
