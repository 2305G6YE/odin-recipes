<h1>Title: My Favourite Recipes</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project involves me using the HTML Foundational lessons I have learnt in TOP (The Odin Project) to create a baseline website using only HTML. To which in the coming weeks I would begin to add other languages such as CSS to form my first portfolio piece.</p>


<h2> Motivation and Problem</h2>
<p>I finally arrived at my first project. Granted it would be a reiteration of what I have learnt before, but I have grown to truly believe the atege: "You learn best by doing". I'm doing this project as part of my first HTML Foundation prerequisite. Thereby after I can fully appreciate and sink my teeth into CSS.</p>

<h2>Learning Takeaways at HTML Foundational Point</h2>
<p>Completing 3 Recipes got me to repetitively type in the boilerplates and occasionally add in HTML elements that I wanted to implement and get practice on, such as fractional numbers using subscript or small elements. I also got more comfortable adding, committing and pushing changes via git and making use of the command line to do the majority of my file tidying. I am very grateful to this project. I hope to implement CSS soon into my future projects so as to make my work more presentable.</p>
