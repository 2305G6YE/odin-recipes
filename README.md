<h1>Title: My Favourite Recipes</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project involves me continuously updating it using new skills I learnt in the foundational course of TOP(The Odin Project).I first implemented HTML on April 2nd, 2025. I then added basic CSS by April 15th, 2025. </p>


<h2> Motivation and Problem</h2>
<p>I finally arrived at my first project. Granted it would be a reiteration of what I have learnt before, but I have grown to truly believe the atege: "You learn best by doing". I'm doing this project as part of my first HTML Foundation prerequisite. Thereby after I can fully appreciate and sink my teeth into CSS.</p>

<h2>Learning Takeaways at HTML Foundational Point (April 3rd 2025)</h2>
<p>Completing 3 Recipes got me to repetitively type in the boilerplates and occasionally add in HTML elements that I wanted to implement and get practice on, such as fractional numbers using subscript or small elements. I also got more comfortable adding, committing and pushing changes via git and making use of the command line to do the majority of my file tidying. I am very grateful to this project. I hope to implement CSS soon into my future projects so as to make my work more presentable.</p>

<h2>Learning Takeaways after CSS Foundational Point (April 15th 2025)</h2>
<p>It was very useful for me to learn about "Live Preview" in VSC as well, letting me see changes to my website in real time. I think I got much more comfortable implementing basic CSS syntaxes and selectors such as class and types, as well as colors, borders and fonts. I would like to have a stronger understanding of positioning, as I feel quite limited moving things around with just margins, alignments and padding. That is where I stand at the moment.</p>
