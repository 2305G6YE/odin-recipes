<h1>Title: My Favourite Recipe</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project involves me using the HTML Foundational lessons I have learnt in TOP (The Odin Project) to create a baseline website using only HTML. To which in the coming weeks I would begin to add other languages such as CSS to form my first portfolio piece.</p>


<h2> Motivation and Problem</h2>
<p>I finally arrived at my first project. Granted it would be a reiteration of what I have learnt before, but I have grown to truly believe the atege: "You learn best by doing". I'm doing this project as part of my first HTML Foundation prerequisite. Thereby after I can fully appreciate and sink my teeth into CSS.</p>
